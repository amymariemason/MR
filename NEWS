Added penalized IVW method (mr_pivw) - thanks to Siqi Xu for coding!

MendelianRandomization v0.7.0
=============================
Added constrained maximum likelihood method (mr_cML) - thanks to Haoran Xue for coding!

MendelianRandomization v0.6.0
=============================
Added debiased IVW method (mr_divw) - thanks to Ting Ye for coding!

MendelianRandomization v0.5.0
=============================
Added multivariable median-based method (mr_mvmedian)
Added MR-Lasso method (mr_lasso)
Added multivariable MR-Lasso method (mr_mvlasso)
Added robust option to multivariable IVW method (mr_mvivw)
Added forest plot function (mr_forest)
Added leave-one-out function (mr_loo)
Added funnel plot function (mr_funnel)
Added functionality for the mr_plot function to be applied to a MRMVInput object

MendelianRandomization v0.4.3
=============================
Updated Phenoscanner function in case of web failure

MendelianRandomization v0.4.1 and v0.4.2
=============================
Bug fixes

MendelianRandomization v0.4.0
=============================
Added multivariable MR-Egger method (mr_mvegger)
Added contamination mixture method (mr_conmix)
Added seamless integration with PhenoScanner via the pheno_input function

MendelianRandomization v0.3.0
=============================
Added mr_mvinput and mr_mvivw for multivariable Mendelian randomization
Added mode-based estimation method of Hartwig et al (mr_mbe) and heterogeneity-penalized mode-based method (mr_hetpen)

MendelianRandomization v0.2.2
=============================
Penalization of weights altered to correspond to Rees et al 2017 (submitted): penalization is now about the median estimate, only variants with heterogeneity p-value less than 0.01 are penalized.

MendelianRandomization v0.2.1
=============================
Minor fix on extract.pheno.csv function that was making SNPs out of order.
Minor fix on p-values from mr_ivw and mr_egger functions.

MendelianRandomization v0.2.0
=============================
New functionality on mr_plot command: static graph (new options "interactive" and "labels").
New command mr_maxlik: implements maximum-likelihood estimation method.
Bug fixes on mr_allmethods command.

MendelianRandomization v0.1.0
=============================
First release.
